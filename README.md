# RegressionUsingFullyConnectedNN_2Linear_Sigmoid
implementing Linear Regression using neural networks containing two linear layer and a Sigmid activation function included to see its effect of our model
### note 
hiddenlayer is a graphical simulator that can implement different layers of neural network for better understanding you might have some problems with it in that case, you can go to pytorch_builder.py source file and change _optimize_trace to _optimize_graph this will solve the problem or you can simply comment this part and skip it
